# 1. Purpose / Intent

This process ensures acquisition and upgrade of skills, knowledge and attitude of all employees of the organization in its overall commitment towards becoming a learning organization.

The Process intent is to develop the skills and knowledge of personnel so they perform their roles efficiently and effectively.

Organizational Training addresses training provided to support the organization's strategic business objectives and to meet the tactical training needs that are common across projects and support groups.

Training needs identified by individual projects and support groups to meet their specific needs are handled at the project and support group level and are outside the scope of the Organizational Training.

Training involves identifying the skills required to perform critical tasks, identifying training needs within each function, and ensuring that needed training is received.

The upgrading of skills and knowledge may come through the following methods:

-   Seminars / Webinars: a structured delivery of a specific topic in a well-defined class room type mode or via delivery over conferencing tool (e.g. Google Meet)
-   Dojo Training and Workshop: Learning session followed by group activities performed by the participants.
-   Internal / External Trainings: Programs, conducted by external agency or internal instructor, which helps to make individuals proficient with specialized instruction and practice.
-   Other Trainings: Computer based Training, On-the -job training, attending exhibition, participating in knowledge forum . It is mandatory for all the Learning and Development activities to qualify against the list of activities authorized as training before receiving the approval for the training request. Thus, the attendance in "Authorized and Approved Trainings" will only track the records of learning to meet ones' respective training hours according to the KRAs. Approvals for the training need to be obtained from the account / program manager and training manager.

Organizational training program involves the following activities:

-   Identifying the training needed by the organization
-   Obtaining and providing training to address those needs
-   Establishing and maintaining a training capability
-   Establishing and maintaining training records
-   Assessing training effectiveness

This process focus on the Webinars, Dojo Trainings and Orientations.

To realize the Quality Policy, the objectives are to ensure that:

-   The training activities are planned
-   Training for developing the skills and knowledge needed to perform software management and technical roles or any other functional roles are provided.
-   Individuals in the software engineering group and software-related groups and from the other functions receive the training necessary to perform their roles and assignments.
-   Training opportunities are made available to all individuals.
-   Learning and Development activities that are available contribute towards an individual's personal development which includes:
-   -   Job-Related Skills
    -   Functional/Technical Skills
    -   Behavioral Skills
    -   Management Development / Professional Skills

# 6. Tasks

Training Plan

Training plans are laid out in coordination with program managers and practice area leads to identify areas which participants and interested in and also in accordance to the program needs. They can be identified and planned out 1-2 months in advance.

In addition, KIC has published a set of custom training paths customized to the employee's current roles. This learning path and directions on how to access the learning resources are available at our Konnect portal.

Training Needs Identification:

Identifying identification of process training needs should be primarily based on the skills that are required to perform the organization's set of standard processes.

While identifying the training needs, also determine which training need is the responsibility of the organization and which are left to the individual project or support group. Such trainings can be done internally within the group or department.

Relevant training opportunities are identified and made available to support each individual's development.

Examples of sources of strategic training needs include the following:

-   The organization's standard processes
-   The organization's strategic business plan
-   The organization's process improvement plan
-   Enterprise level initiatives
-   Skill assessments
-   Risk analyses
-   Acquisition and supplier management

Training needs are identified for each individual that support the development needs and interests identified during performance appraisals conducted with them.

Potential matches are sought between training opportunities and development needs.

Within the limits of available training resources, training is provided when beneficial matches with an individual's developmental needs are identified.

Frequency: Meetings are held every two weeks to identify training needs and plans for the subsequent months of the types of Dojo training and Brownbags/webinars to be conducted.

Training needs will be identified by following tools:

-   Performance appraisals: The training requirements will be captured from the needs identified through the Employee Performance Appraisal.
-   Project requirements/work profile requirements: Each project/work profile has its own set of requirements and expectations from members who will be working for the project, a well-defined work requirement can highlight the training needs for such team members working for the project.
-   Skill gap: There are chances that we have employees with requisite skills; however the requirement for these skills could be on a higher proficiency level. Such differences in proficiency level can be taken care of by imparting training.
-   By Senior Management: Senior Management may from time to time request for some specific training program on the basis of Business plan/needs through Training Identification Form from Senior Management.
-   PD observation: PD Manager with Program Managers will frequently interact with employees and observe the employees' behavior and attitude at work. Such observations can be organization wide and can contribute to training needs.
-   Member request: The training request from the employee in order to be more effective and efficient with his work will also contribute towards identification of training needs.
-   Based on the Training needs, Organizational Training Plan is prepared. Organizational training plans will be developed using Training Plan, and should contain the following:
-   -   Training needs
    -   Training topics
    -   Schedules based on training activities and their dependencies
    -   Methods used for training
    -   Requirements and quality standards for training materials
    -   Training tasks, roles, and responsibilities
    -   Required resources including tools, facilities, environments, staffing, and skills, and
    -   Knowledge
-   The training need identified through these tools or received through individual request via the Konnect portal will be stored and managed in Konnect.

Learning and development Calendar

Karsun Intranet Portal (Konnect Portal) is used to host all training calendar and resource information, including dates and times of training.

Participants who wish to participate in the training will register via the Konnect portal. Participants who have registered and approved by their supervisors to attend these trainings will subsequently be added in the class training invite managed through a group calendar Karsun Academy([academy@karsun-llc.com](mailto:academy@karsun-llc.com)).
